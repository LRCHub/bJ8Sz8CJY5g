We have met, and we have parted;
you're all this world to me.
if you do not love me, darlin',
in my grave i'd rather be.
i wish i had a golden box
to put my true love in.
i'd take her out, and i'd kiss her twice,
and i'd put her back again.

hello, mr. sky!
won't ya hitch up my pony?
hello, mr. sky--
saddle up my black mare?

i'm going to find a rider, maybe,
in this world, somehow.
grief, thunderbirds with flies' wings
smashin' thru screen doors, uh-huh--
how i want to see them, see them lined up.
even your own family can betray you.
to their own music the road shall dance.

hello, mr. sky!
hello, hangman!

true, in wonderment--
is it hopeless ecstasy i want?
