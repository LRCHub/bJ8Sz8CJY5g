MOTHER - FUCKING - BOBA

Boys and we kicking down your freaking door
Grab the mic, drop the beat, spilling boba on the floor
Kick a hole up in your speaker pull the mic and then I jet
Got matching trueno 86's for the whole set
Drifting up and down the mountain climb
Swerving out just killing time
Speeding all up out the lot we need some mochi what you got
Then you see us in the limbo rocking out to funky beats
Yeah, just the average life of LBC's Successful NEETS
Yakisoba Sipping, Thai Tea Tripping
We're those mother fucking boys up in this shit just so legit
Our only role in life is to get on the mic and fucking spit
A thousand words a minute, our ambition has no limits
And I pull up fresh in that Subaru with the freaking crew 1992
You talking shit on the boba clique grab a spirit gun bouta hit a lick
I stay balling your girl agreed, I be slam dunking these boba seeds
Fuck Jordan's they're not important I'll rock Kioshis Addidas please

Boba Boyz yeah we back, and we got the shit that you lack
You know the flow is crazy we're just fucking lazy
Go hard as fuck I'm just saying, real shit I'm not playing
And I know you better feel me everybody tryna be us
Can't nobody fucking beat us
We vanish in the winter, can't nobody fucking see us
Sipping on the boba tea, motherfucker you know me
Ain't no fucking sugar free we got that yakisoba
That fucking teriyaki with yo bitch
Netflix- fuck that, Crunchy Roll and Kick It
But kid you better listen,
if we throwing shows you better cop a ticket
Show us that you with it just to say you fucking did it
Life is a bullet: we bit it, this group is a flame: you lit it
Made us big yeah you did it, now we back and we rapping
No sleep we ain't napping
Coming back with the heat, yeah we drift to the beat
Boba Boyz yeah we made it, made this track and you played it
Thank you, you saved it

Copping gold from Skypia cash just comes in loads
Nigga your lineups more fucked up than rainbow roads
I got beef
I step up to the mic and keep it brief
Spreading farther than the motherfucking barrier reef
I'll be a thief, and steal your girl heart then return it
You want senpai's attention? Well then chick you better earn it
I got niggas stepping up to me like i give a fuck
I'll straight pull out the master
sword and wish your dumb ass "good luck"
Don't be a cuck you fucking suck, we really running the game
And ever since we showed up, shit was never the same
I'm stepping to the plate it's surely time to wreck it
Just slid your girl a mix tape and i told that chick to check it
So pay attention 'cause this lessons far from done
My losing ratio is like zero so run
And all this victory is clogging up my damn dreams
Ain't no point in looking if i'm not gone find an answer
I stay spreading through your body like like some nasty kind of cancer
Steady stepping through these niggas idolizing like a stencil
With the lighter that's my pencil

Yeah so take a seat cause you can't compete
'Cause we're the dope ass boyz with the dope ass noise
Rewind and repeat, red chucks on my feet cause I come with the heat
PAUSE
Yo' girl on my dick yeah she beating my meat
You can't fuck with my squad, you can't fuck with my team on the beat
You're just facing defeat, yeah you stupid
Bitch you wanna start shit, so just do it
It's Kai on the beat, yeah you already knew it
Come to the party can't play shit, lame ass niggas can't say shit
Destroying every bar that they spit
Never heard a flow quite like mine, you can't place it
Time travel to the lab and displace it
Change faces and changed places
So my bars have temporal displacement
2DKai with no spaces
Now I'm getting quiet don't say shit
You can't win so just face it
Just praise it
